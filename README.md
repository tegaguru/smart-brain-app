# What's this about
Just a fun little project that I worked on, after watching a tutorial by Andrei(Big Thanks Sir).
So yeah, you basically feed it a link to any image(like I mean, any image) and it helps you in detecting if there's a face.

## Technologies behind it
I made use of [Clarifai API](https://www.clarifai.com/) - Helps with the Image recognition

I used React for the Front End, and a little bit of Redux(I know this wasn't necessary but ...)

Oh yeah, and a ton of npm packages lol... just check my package.json.


### Note: you'd need to get your api key from [here](https://www.clarifai.com/) to run this, thanks!
