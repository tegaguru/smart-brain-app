# What's this about
Just a fun little project that i worked, after watching a tutorial by Andrei(Big thanks Sir).
You basically feed it a link to any image(like i mean, any image) and it helps you in detecting if there's a face.

## Technologies behind it
I made use of [Clarifai API](https://www.clarifai.com/) - Helps with the Image recognition

I used React for the Front End, and a little bit of Redux(I know this wasn't necessary but ...)

Oh yeah, and a ton of npm packages lol... just check my package.json abeg
